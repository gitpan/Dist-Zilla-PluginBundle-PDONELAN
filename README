NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::PDONELAN - Dist::Zilla pre-wired for PDONELAN

VERSION
    version 1.200

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Dist::Zilla plugin bundle.

    Please see the (nicely commented) source code to see which plugins this
    module bundles - I already have to list them twice in the source just to
    make this work - three times would drive me nuts.

METHODS
  configure
    Adds the list of plugins (and bundles) in order
